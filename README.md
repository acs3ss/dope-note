# dope-notes

_Created at RamHacks 2018 by Austin Sullivan, Andrew Lewis, Winston Liu, and Grace Wu_ 

Our project, _dope-notes_, is aimed at college students who want to find a community interface to more easily take notes. Our website has several features:
- **Upload feature**: users can upload YouTube links of their lectures and then _dope-notes_ will take the captions of the video and then transcribe them into a text file. Our program will then parse the text file for keywords and extract them, giving the user a general, concise summary of what the video is. 
- **Supplemental information**: Are you that student looking for more information to broaden your knowledge? Look no further! With one simple click of a button, our website can link you to all information relevant to your notes on websites such as Khan Academy, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia, etc. so you don't have to do the research. 
- **Community**: Want to compare notes with your classmates in the same class? We introduced a feature that allows you to connect with other people in the same classes as you so you can see how your notes stack up to your peers. Collaboration is a big part of college and we hope that this tool will make it easier for students to work together. 

_Dope-notes_ was written using Django as the front-end and various machine learning algorithms on the back-end. In the future, we hope to expand our website and improve upon the UI, add more user-friendly features such as being able to upload videos from your local computer, adding additional filters for supplemental information, gamification for community notes, etc.
